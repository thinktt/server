  "readme": "# node-force-domain\n\nnode-force-domain is a middleware for Connect and Epxpress that redirects any request to a default domain.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me using [@goloroden](https://twitter.com/goloroden) on Twitter.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install node-force-domain\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to integrate node-force-domain into your application. For that add a reference to the `node-force-domain` module.\n\n```javascript\nvar forceDomain = require('node-force-domain');\n```\n\nIf you now want to redirect your requests to a specific host, include the middleware and configure it accordingly:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(forceDomain({\n  hostname: 'www.example.com'\n}));\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can also specify a port and a target protocol:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(forceDomain({\n  hostname: 'www.example.com',\n  port: 4000,\n  protocol: 'https'\n}));\n```\n\nBy default, node-force-domain creates a `temporary` request. If you want to use a `permanent` redirect instead, specify it as redirection type:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(forceDomain({\n  hostname: 'www.example.com',\n  type: 'permanent'\n}));\n```\n\nPlease note that `localhost` is always being excluded from redirection. Hence you can continue developing locally as you are used to.\n\n### Using a reverse-proxy\n\nIf you are running your web application behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx, you have to forward the originally requested host:\n\n    server {\n      // ...\n\n      location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n      }\n    }\n\n## Running the tests\n\nnode-force-domain has been developed using TDD. To run the tests, go to the folder where you have installed node-force-domain to and run `npm test`. You need to have [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) installed.\n\n    $ npm test\n\nAdditionally, this module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, Grunt also analyses the code using [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/). To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed node-force-domain and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.\n\n    $ grunt\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2013 Golo Roden.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
