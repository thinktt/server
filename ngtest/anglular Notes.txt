Invoking Angular
1. Load js
2. use ng-app directive (tell angular what part of DOM to use)

Model View Controller - All Agular apps have: 
* A model containing data, representing current state of app
* Views that display this data
* Controllers that manage the relationship between model and views

ng-change(callback) (when field changes call callback)
ng-submit (a form attr, set equal to callback, default post will be stopped )
ng-click (attr, set equal to a callback for click event)

ng-repeat = "thing in things" (make elements by iterating trhough an object) 
$first, $middle, $last, $repeat (some usable variables during the iteration)


$scope.$watch(thingToWatch, callback) (watch for var change then run callback)
